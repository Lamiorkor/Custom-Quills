# Custom Quills
 This is my E-Commerce Final Project where I created a custom poetry writing service business with an e-commerce platform.


## Overview  
Custom Quills is a personalized poetry-writing platform focused on blending African cultural values with modern digital convenience. Customers can order custom poetry for special occasions, and writers craft these poems to suit the customer's preferences.

## Features  
- **Personalized Poetry**: Customers specify themes, tones, and details to create unique poems.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Specific dashboards for Writers, Customers, and Administrators.  
- **Order Management**: Place, cancel, view, and track poetry orders.  
- **Payment Integration**: Seamless payments using Paystack.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript.  
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL.  
- **Payment Gateway**: Paystack.  

## Installation  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-quills.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** cd Custom-Quills
3. **Set up the database:**
Use the provided SQL scripts in the /db folder to set up the database.
4. **Configure database credentials:**
Update settings/db_class.php with your database details.
5. **Run the project:**
Use a local server like XAMPP or WAMP to run the project.

## Usage
**For Customers:**
- Register, log in, and place poetry orders.
- Pay securely via Paystack.
- Manage and track order status.
  
**For Writers:**

- Mark orders as completed and email poems to customers.
  
**For Administrators:**

## Security Measures
1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Ensures only authorized users can access specific features.
2. SQL Injection Protection: Secure database queries using prepared statements.

##Future Enhancements
1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for additional security.
2. Encrypted Communications to protect sensitive customer data.
3. Physical Delivery Options for poems (e.g., framed prints).
